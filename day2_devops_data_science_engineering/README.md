# DevOps + Data Science + Engineering

- Mentor DS on ops practices and standards
- Expect people to be skeptical of DevOps practices - need to understand why
- Productionization of "research" code - research does not ??? production ???
- Move production ownership out of informatics teams
- Pipeline to test and update model - security scans
- Strip out PII and put data in a "data lake"
- Frame thoughts (?) as questions to get better buy-in
- Sell the collaboration
- Automation & repeatability + other concepts can be taught & introduced to DS
- Make it easy to do the right thing - get management buy-in
- Use a data scrubbing pipeline
- Data scientists not up to date with latest concepts and best practices
- Move on to next problem, not support existing code
- Ownership of code
- Code & data interconnected
- Engineering best practices not followed: pushing to master
- Meetings to help resolve issues with processes
- Get a process and stick with it
