# Metrics and Monitoring

- Accelerate DevOps Handbook
 - Deploys per day
 - MTTR
 - Time to production / market
 - Change failure rate
- Business metrics? AWS costs saved, $ value of reduced downtime, sales not lost
- Integrated tools for creating metrics: Prometheus vs Influx vs DataDog vs New Relic
- Firehose model vs decision-driven data collection ("when there's a hurricane, every single alert goes off at the same time")
- Stop guessing
- what do you do with the metric? blame?
- don't panic :fire: :fire: :fire: attention to reader's emotional state for remediation playbooks
- writing clearly is very hard
- english training; code review processes for documentation
- out of date knowledge base
- Effective Docs: seperate "how" from "why" # state of panic
- well, how do you prevent devs from letting env specs go out of date?
- wiki coverage metrics
- metrics for human single points of failure, overspecialization metrics, "that one engineer"
- MTTR over PTO: does anyone taking PTO significantly increase MTTR? enforced PTO as stress-testing
- distribution of commit authors per microservice (including related design documents, wikis, documentation)
- pedagogy, cultural expectations
- onboarding as code (e.g. A/B tests for your training process) vs non-formalist approaches to training
- VCS for onboarding process
- formalism breeds laziness
- why does someone make unreasonable requests? XY problems
- live notetaking, agendas with links explaining things
- managing WIP
- visualize your capacity and load
- visualize priorities
- important vs urgent (will become important later)
- burnout: overwork, underwork, toxic environment. psychological safety
- saying no
