# DevOpsDays Boston 2019 Open Spaces

This repo is for storing photos and transcriptions of open spaces **post-it whiteboards**, a mechanism to capture the essence of the conversation for later reference. The primary goal of transcription is to promote accessibility in all aspects of the conference.


# Contributions

All transcriptions are the result of various community members via our Slack group and #devopsdays19 channel for the event. This is an outgrowth of the suggestion in [Open Spaces Format](https://devopsdays.org/open-space-format/): "Have a wiki where people can record outcomes of sessions...", with minor improvement to this statement to respect privacy considerations in an event/public domain.

# Privacy

Privacy of conversation contributors is preserved by ensuring that no names are included in transcripts and if present in photos, is omitted. As open spaces are an at-will forum open to hundreds of conference attendees and facilitated by organizers and volunteers, confidentiality is not assumed. However, in keeping with community and global DevOpsDays principles, the conference preserves the spirit of safety in open spaces sessions through facilitators and in keeping with the [Open Spaces Format](https://devopsdays.org/open-space-format/).
