# Challenges Managing K8s
- Limit Registry for security.
- Have to enable audit logging in K8s. Off by default.
- Managing K8s manifests.
- Developer autonomy.
- Resource right sizing.
- Cluster autoscaler can be tricky.
- OPA - Open Policy Agent.
- AKS is great!
- "Talks might get recorded, OpenSpaces doesn't...why I'm here!"
- APM everywhere.
- Easy rollback, canary, A/B deploys.
- Self service.
- Devs need to make / metrics tabs (+ health checks).
- eks ctl fun weave roles.
- Cluster upgrades painful.
- App per namespace, cluster per env.
- Upgrades: in place, or new cluster?
- Autoscaling: vertical, horizontal, cluster.
- Cluster API is becoming a standard.
- Tiller is insecure.
- CI/CD vuln scans on containers.
- Apps/Devs need to output metrics/healthchecks.
- Avoid state in k8s apps.
- Avoid app state!# Ephemeral Workstations

- Ansible to set up your developmemnt environment as code
- Kickstart versus post-install
- Use modules if available (user versus `chsh`)
- Jessie Frazelle - developer who has done a lot of work in desktop containerization
- To start list what you want to persist across workstations
- Persistent data:
  - Backups
  - Git
  - GDrive / OneDrive
- Config data versus Hard data versus secure data (login)
- Veracrypt (new-age truecrypt)
- VeraCrypt/Arclone/encrypted backups
- Snap, Flatpack, addimage - new packaging
- Ansible Galaxy - modules ??? trust
- Work the way I want versus achieve the objective
- Personal machine - long-lived data as a risk
- Kiosk resets / employee laptop onboarding / cloud/thin-client
- SyncThing: sync changes for specific files live!
- Take time to research bugs
- Restic backup client
- Github cohoe workstation
- What would freak you out if your own workstation laptop was blown away?
