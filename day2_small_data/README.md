# Small Data

Data that is small enough for human comprehension
- What does that actually mean?
- What are some examples of small data?
- How do we use small data in our daily work?

---

- "Human comprehension" - what is the barrier for tools?
- Small enough to fit on "one page"
- Does "human comprehension" mean processing or retaining?
- "Individual person data" - Nightscout? Heart rate? Caffeine consumption
- glucose.REDACTED
  - Monitoring and alerting one person's data that's collected & processed by a smartphone
- Does the duration of retaining and/or working with the data matter?
  - In the small data world we almost never collect data we expect to never use for anything.
- Separation of data - i.e. per person
- Visualizations - big data visualized as small data
- Where is the cutoff from small to big data?
- Does "medium" data exist? What would it be?
- How does small data fit with DevOps?
- Historical data monitoring
- Data in context
- Intuition - subconscious is still calculating / inferring
- Human brain is constantly passively collecting data
- Use technology to help us do the job - rather than us adapting to current technology
- NLP - for big data - probably not that good at things like "summarizing slack" (yet)
- Examples:
  - Metadata needed to build a stack, tagging
  - Lists of phone numbers
  - Wearables (i.e. heart rate on Apple watch)
  - Journals & notetaking!
  - "Quantified Self" (Example)
  - Focus groups + surveys
  - Instant messaging
  - Single strings of streaming data
