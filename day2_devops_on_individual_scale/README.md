# DevOps on the scale of an individual, mental health, personal wellness
- Systems thinking
- theory of constraints, left to right flows in our personal lives
- humans aren't rational agents, "we write ourselves like we write 3rd party vendors"
- asking for help
- personal debt
- resentment
- heroics in a company / heroics internally
- punishing failure discourages change
- blame is familiar, forces you to be better, protects you
- ideologies of minimizing MTTR vs never failing
- right to left flows: underlying cause, 5 whys. was there a problem, what decision lead to it, what predictions led to that decision, what models led to that prediction
- tighter loops, shorter release/deploy cycles for self-improvement, iterative change. bullet journaling and socialization as strategies for this.
- visibility
- unplanned work, "Making Work Visible" by Dominica Degrondes
- keeping track of your time, false sense of personal capacity
- self-communication skills; interpersonal vs intra-personal boundaries
