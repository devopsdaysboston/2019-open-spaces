# Alarm Fatigue (stop hitting yourself)
- Hacker News thread defending hiding rewards for fixing outages to avoid incentivizing outages :disappointed:
- Goodhart's Law: "Once a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure."
- Dark side of optimizing for business impact -> you get what you incentivize.
- Many orgs have lack of responsibility & ownership of business processes.
- "It was this or pig farming" - challenge of retraining people who'd been taught not to communicate.
- PMs willing to block for the team.
- "How do we deprogram people who come from a crappy environment?" slow, can blow up teams.
- Better feedback loops + knowledge sharing could help.
- Analogy to love languages - what is reinforced? Business end: not everyone can be reached, so how to make money?
- Reinforcement is important & tricky to do. It's easier to create interaction problems than solve them.
- How do you deliver negative feedback / give people constructive areas of improvement?
- Make sure you're communicating well and being detailed.
- It's the process not the person.
- Steam game: Don't Touch Anything. Sometimes doing nothing is the right answer.
- Steam game: Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes.
- Let's work to solve better, then solve more.
- Is this a problem? Or is it a context switching problem?
- Alarm fatigue is bad for humans & infrastructure. It's a kind of cultural / design anti-pattern.
- Assume positive intent and help provide feedback.
